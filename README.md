# Flax Parrel Sync
This is experimental port of (ParrelSync)[https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync] to Flax Engine. There are mostly UI and internal changes to make it work with Flax Engine so all docs should work with this version too.

Parrel Sync window is available in Tools section. Currently the UI is not responsive and is missing progress bar popups so its recommended to close and open window again after creating or deleting the clone.
